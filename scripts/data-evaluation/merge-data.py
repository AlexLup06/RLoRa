read data from all nodes
-> merge into a singe array of:

    - added to queue id from "addedToQueueId"
    - create an array of two types 
        1. start of transmission 
        2. end of transmission
        and sort them chronologically


once merging is done we can do the following to get out wanted data

effective thoughput:
    we already have this data available 


whole thoughput:
    we already havre this data available

usage of the medium:
    -> here we calculate the usage of the medium for a single second. If the we have a transmissin starting at 1.5 and finishin at 3.4 then the usage would be
    0% for the first second, 50% for thr second second, 100% for the third and 40% for the fourth
    - we are using the array with the start and the end of an array

    tms = []
    usage = []
    lastTm = 0
    activeTms = 0
    start = 0 
    second = 0
    for tm in tms
        if 
       if tm == start 

collisions:
    gets counted within the module
